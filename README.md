# summary
 Based on the physics â…  problem, this program created a predictive natural language processing model with a neuron network model using Orange3. I loaded that model into Python and built the GUI using Tkinter. When you input a problem, it predicts the problem unit through the model and randomly recommends the unit problem prepared in advance.

# why the project started
 While helping my friend's graduation thesis, I was looking for an easy way to make a model and use it, so I decided to use Orange3. However, there were many difficulties in loading the Orange3 model in Python, so I leave a project record.
 
 Of course, I see "Orange is not really intended to be used as a library. I would suggest using it via GUI or rather using other Python libraries, such as sklearn, on which Orange is based anyway." in [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56579707/16530517)

 Nevertheless, I hope this project will help those who are having the same problem as me.

# needed features
 1. Create a model with Orange3.
 2. Load the model.
 3. I use the camera with opencv.
 4. Select Take Photo/Recognize Image/Enter Text.
 5. When taking a picture is selected, the camera turns on and a window to take a picture appears.
 6. After taking a picture, OCR with pytesseract.
 7. When OCR is finished, a window will appear where you can edit the text.
 8. After modification, use the model to derive results.
 9. Based on the derived results, 5 random problems are recommended in the img_data folder. Then go back to step 4.
 10. If image recognition is selected, you can select a file from the folder and try steps 6 to 9.
 11. When text input is selected, a window for writing text appears and repeat steps 8 to 9.
